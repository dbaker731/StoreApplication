# Store Application

## Project Description
I will be creating an application to act as an online store front for a fake compant called "TargMart". Users will be able to create new accounts, login, add items to cart, and checkout. Admin users will be able to create new stores, create new items, and assign inventory to stores. Users will be able to review their past orders, while admins can view all orders from a selected store or user.
